Harmain Link Website Template (Single-Page)
--------------------------------------------------
Files:
- index.html (everything is in one file: HTML + CSS + JS)

How to use:
1) Open index.html in any browser.
2) Replace placeholder prices ($X,XXX) and package details.
3) For real bookings + payments:
   - Add a backend (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, or a simple server) to store form submissions
   - Connect Stripe/PayPal for deposits or full payments
   - Add a "Thank You" page + automated confirmation email

Quick upgrade ideas:
- Add a "Departure city" dropdown and calculate estimated price
- Add an embedded Google Form as the official submission
- Add a Stripe Payment Link button for deposit checkout
